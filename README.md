# Datasetmovies

IMPORTANT: Run the network_movies.Rmd first and only then can the app.R be launched.
          Run time of the network_movies.Rmd is roughly 3 minutes.

It was not possible to make a self-standing shiny.app due to the time constraints, but this could be a next step for the next update.

Several improvements were made for the updated version of this project.
The run time of the notebook.rmd was improved by several minutes and is now down to 2/3 minutes.
Due to this more movies can be used in the graph, adjacency matrix and ultimately the shiny.app which leads to better recommendations.
Furthermore a package was made encapsulating four important functions.
Lastly the data is now called from an outside environment.

Thank you for reading the README :)
